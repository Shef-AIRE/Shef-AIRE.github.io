&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overview&lt;/strong>: Our project aims to investigate novel methods to leverage a special type of multimodal data—multi-fidelity data—to improve AI model accuracy and efficiency, leading to scalable solutions in computationally intensive optimisation problems in various engineering disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Motivation&lt;/strong>: Our goal is to create innovative techniques and toolsets capable of assimilating and being able to use multi-fidelity data effectively (i.e., providing the same outputs of high-fidelity datasets using lower-fidelity datasets), such as simulation outcomes from both coarse and dense meshes, and signals from high-cost precision sensors and low-cost basic sensors. We aim to enhance AI model accuracy without relying on highly accurate data obtained from high-cost precision sensors only, whilst improving efficiency metrics such as training time and memory cost. We will implement the proposed method in simulation-based testing for autonomous driving systems (ADS) to demonstrate the capability for the safety and reliability of self-driving cars with low-cost computation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multimodal AI for Parkinson's Disease</title><link>https://shef-AIRE.github.io/project/parkinson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shef-AIRE.github.io/project/parkinson/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>University of Sheffield Collaborating Faculties&lt;/strong>: Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN) and Faculty of Engineering&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overview&lt;/strong>: Our project is dedicated to the development of artificial intelligence tools for Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease, designed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the condition and predict its progression. This initiative integrates data from multiple modalities—including genetic data, biomarkers, environmental factors, and medical examinations—utilizing advanced AI methodologies such as contrastive learning, foundation models, and causal discovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Motivation&lt;/strong>: The growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease reflects a comprehensive appreciation of the condition&amp;rsquo;s widespread impact, its escalating incidence, the existing gaps in our comprehension, and the extraordinary research opportunities afforded by current data repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the UK, Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease presents a formidable public health challenge. Its widespread nature underlines the pressing demand for novel treatment and management strategies, positioning AI as an ideal candidate to drive forward innovative solutions. Globally, the frequency of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease is on the rise, affecting an ever-growing number of individuals either directly or putting them at a significant risk of developing the condition. This increasing trend accentuates the urgent necessity for interventions that are both scalable and efficacious, areas where AI technology shines with potential. Despite thorough research efforts, the core mechanisms behind Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease remain a mystery. Here, AI&amp;rsquo;s ability to sift through and analyze large, complex datasets could unlock new understanding, setting the stage for transformative developments in how we treat and prevent the disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK Biobank&lt;/a>, with its comprehensive data, emerges as a pivotal resource for AI research. The extensive scope of this data lays a robust groundwork for the creation and refinement of AI models, fostering considerable progress in our grasp and handling of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s. Leveraging AI, researchers are not just shedding light on the elusive causes of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease but are also crafting predictive models that foresee the disease&amp;rsquo;s trajectory, pinpoint therapeutic targets, and ultimately, instill hope in the countless lives touched by this afflictive illness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the convergence of AI and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease research heralds an exciting era in the battle against neurodegenerative diseases. It offers a beacon of hope for enhancing patient outcomes, marking a vital step forward in our journey towards understanding, managing, and eventually overcoming such conditions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
