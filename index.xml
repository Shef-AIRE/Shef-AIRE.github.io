&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;b>Overview&lt;/b>: Our project aims to develop a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) system which can process multi-modal, multi-vendor, multi-centre, and multi-pathophysiological cardiothoracic data, such as Chest Radiographs (CXR), Echocardiogram (ECG), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electronic Health Record (EHR) and doctors reports of a patients, to segment and classify pathophysiological features and improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response prediction of Cardiothoracic Disease (CTD) such as Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Abnormal Heart Rhythms (AHR) to a level at which advanced methods such as contrastive learning, foundation model, meta-learning, few-shot and zero-shot learning can successfully extract interpretable clinical parameters.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;b>Motivation&lt;/b>: CDT refers to a variety of conditions that affect the heart and lungs, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, lung cancer, and diseases of the chest wall. These illnesses can impact the overall function and structure of the heart and lungs, and they often require specialised care, potentially including surgery. Despite substantial progress in medical technology, the early diagnosis of these diseases remains a challenge due to the complexity of disease development and the vague symptoms produced in the early stages. In our initial study, we will utilize the MIMIC datasets, which comprise various data modalities within a comprehensive open-access database. This dataset has been the foundation for high-quality research in areas ranging from intensive care and mortality prediction to disease classification in pathology. Additionally, we will use the in-house dataset, ASPER, provided by our collaborator, which also offers multiple data modalities, to further test our model. In the short term, the project's success could lead to improved diagnosis and monitoring of CDT, potentially reducing the need for invasive procedures and facilitating personalised treatment plans. In the long term, our AI system could be adapted to more cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, revolutionising the approach to cardiothoracic medicine and benefiting countless patients worldwide.

BLN is a major corpus of over 200 years of scanned British newspapers from over 240 newspapers with textual data, visual data, and metadata available. Scanned newspaper images have undergone OCR (optical character recognition) processing, resulting in inaccurate transcriptions due to degradation of the original documents. The project aims to employ advanced deep learning techniques to improve the quality of these transcriptions. The final outputs will be high-quality corrected transcriptions of BLN and open-source code for OCR text correction, both of which would serve as valuable resources for humanities researchers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;b>Motivation&lt;/b>: Since the early 2000s, significant digitisation efforts have been undertaken to preserve and make accessible historical primary sources such as newspapers, early printed books, and handwritten documents. While these efforts have been instrumental in advancing humanities research, the low quality of OCR transcriptions remains a significant barrier to discovering new historical insights. The successful completion of this project promises both short-term and long-term benefits. In the short term, it will significantly enhance the transcription quality of BLN, enabling accurate and efficient searching within the collection as well as unlocking the potential for text mining, which was previously impractical due to low transcription quality. In the long term, the project's success could revolutionise research on other large collections of historical documents, allowing researchers to track content changes, language evolution, and shifts in thought across different time periods. By being language-independent, the impact could extend to historical documents worldwide, advancing research on a global scale.
