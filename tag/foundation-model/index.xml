&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overview&lt;/strong>:
This project uses AI to accelerate the discovery of new materials crucial for green technologies. It explores both data and modelling aspects to predict material composition and properties, through two case studies: permanent magnetic materials and novel corrosion-resistant coatings.
The project uses machine learning algorithms for predictions, drawing on both existing and self-generated databases enriched by natural language processing. It addresses inherent challenges like data scarcity and imbalance through data augmentation and the integration of machine learning with physics-based models.
The project will deliver high-quality methodologies, open-source code, and a user-friendly interface to broaden the application of these predictive capabilities.
This has the potential to revolutionize materials discovery by enabling the software to autonomously predict material properties from specified compositions, paving the way for significant breakthroughs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Motivation&lt;/strong>:
The demand for sustainable technologies requires the discovery of novel materials with superior properties.
Traditional methods for materials discovery are time-consuming and resource-intensive due to their reliance on physical experiments and iterative testing, limited by both practical laboratory setups and human imagination.
This project bridges this gap by harnessing the power of AI, using machine learning algorithms, digital databases, and computational tools. This significantly reduces the time it takes to translate a concept into a material with desired properties.
By enabling autonomous prediction of material properties, this project has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science. In the short term, it can accelerate the discovery cycle, leading to faster development of solar cells and energy-efficient materials. In the long term, this project could pave the way for entirely new materials with unforeseen properties, ultimately propelling advancements across diverse fields like aerospace, medicine, and electronics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Text Correction for Historical Documents</title><link>https://shef-AIRE.github.io/project/historical-doc-text-correction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shef-AIRE.github.io/project/historical-doc-text-correction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>University of Sheffield Collaborating Faculties&lt;/strong>: Faculty of Arts &amp;amp; Humanities, Faculty of Engineering, Digital Humanities Institute (DHI)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overview&lt;/strong>: This project addresses the critical issue of correcting noisily OCR&amp;rsquo;d historical documents, focusing on the &lt;a href="https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/british-library-newspapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Library Newspapers (BLN) collection&lt;/a>. BLN is a major corpus of over 200 years of scanned British newspapers from over 240 newspapers with textual data, visual data, and metadata available. Scanned newspaper images have undergone OCR (optical character recognition) processing, resulting in inaccurate transcriptions due to the degradation of the original documents. The project aims to employ advanced deep-learning techniques to improve the quality of these transcriptions. The final outputs will be high-quality corrected transcriptions of BLN and open-source code for OCR text correction, both of which would serve as valuable resources for humanities researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Motivation&lt;/strong>: Since the early 2000s, significant digitisation efforts have been undertaken to preserve and make accessible historical primary sources such as newspapers, early printed books, and handwritten documents. While these efforts have been instrumental in advancing humanities research, the low quality of OCR transcriptions remains a significant barrier to discovering new historical insights. The successful completion of this project promises both short-term and long-term benefits. In the short term, it will significantly enhance the transcription quality of BLN, enabling accurate and efficient searching within the collection as well as unlocking the potential for text mining, which was previously impractical due to low transcription quality. In the long term, the project&amp;rsquo;s success could revolutionise research on other large collections of historical documents, allowing researchers to track content changes, language evolution, and shifts in thought across different time periods. By being language-independent, the impact could extend to historical documents worldwide, advancing research on a global scale.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
